This app combines a motion detection program with a bokeh graphical output. Requires a webcam. Run plotting.py to activate the motion detection program. Press q to stop the camera. Output is a Motion_Graph.html file with the bokeh graph, a Times.csv file with the motion start and stop times, and a motion_output.avi file of the recording with the motion detection squares shown. Running the motion_detector.py file will do the same but without the bokeh html file. It is important that there is no motion in the first frame for an accurate result. Based on a Udemy python megacourse with formatting and output changes by me.
